## Profile
Hello, my name is Adam and I am a first-year in the MURP program concentrating in RID. I am from Massachusetts, and enjoy travel, geography, and photographing new cities.

## Course Description
My understanding of the course is that it teaches GIS and Python skills to better engage with geospatial data. 

## Project Ideas
One idea I have is to build on a personal GIS project I did this past quarter in which I conducted a location analysis for a hypothetical photography shop: strategizing a single site at which they should open for business across all of LA. I would hope to take my workflow to the next level with more complex data analysis and GIS techniques. 

## Course Objectives
My objective in this course is to build on my Python and GIS skills, and learn how to leverage Python for GIS.
