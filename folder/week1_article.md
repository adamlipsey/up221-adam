Where Internet Connection Costs More in the US

**** Summary

This article discusses the "affordability gap" of broadband internet access in the United States; namely, the fact that America's lowest-earning states – often rural areas – face more expensive internet rates because they are more physically spread out, so providers have less incentive to compete in these regions. Therefore, these states have lower access to the lowest-costing internet plans in the market than the highest-earning states do. This article speaks to me and my goals for the course because it deals with the topic of disparity based on the interplay of economic and spatial factors. 

**** Map review

I think that the main map in the article was produced in Geopandas based on the color scheme and axis style. I personally think the map is fine, but I am curious to see what it would look like with a monochromatic color scheme, such as darker green = more available; lighter green = less available. For this particular representation, I think a graduated style gets the pont across, and it is distracting to have random colors assigned to percentages, so the eye needs to keep returning to the axis to know what color is what value.
